# UltraNES

**Note: still WIP and might not finish without your help**

What if your friendly neighborhood Nintendo Entertainment System was built today? Basically if the system had more ram and rom.

## Features

* Pure ANSI C11 library
  * Bring your own program
* Simple functional abstraction for the graphics
  * Not as limited as the original
* Interrupts as events
* Sound (hopefully)
* SDL2 backend
* Keyboard input
* Dev tools
